	Use:   "definition-space",
	Short: "Lookup and learn words using a dictionary API.",
	Long: `definition-space allows you to lookup words from your CLI and add them to a local dictionary.
	The dictionary is initialised in $HOME/.definition-space/dictionary.json when you first call 'definition-space add [word]'
	The API used is https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/.
	After adding words to your dictionary, you can check a word with 'check', print the whole thing with 'mydict', learn words with 'learn', remove words with 'remove', and clear everything with 'cleardict'.
